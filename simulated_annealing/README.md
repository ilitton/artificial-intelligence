### Goal:
* Implement the simulated annealing algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals

### Repo Structure:
* [`AIND-Simulated_Annealing.ipynb`](./AIND-Simulated_Annealing.ipynb): solution and walkthrough 

### Setup:

* Recommended install: [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook AIND-Simulated_Annealing.ipynb
