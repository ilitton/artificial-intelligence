--

### Demo:
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="./pacman.gif"/></div> 

### Goal:
* Use **BFS**, **DFS**, and **A*** to teach Pac-Man to search his world to complete the following tasks:
 * Find a single obstacle
 * Find multiple obstacles
 * Find the fastest way to eat all the food in the map

### Repo Structure:
* [`./src/`](./src/): source code from UC Berkeley AI division found [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa10/projects/search/search.html)
  * Implemented search algorithms and agents found in [`search.py`](./src/search.py) and [`searchAgents.py`](./src/searchAgents.py) 

### Note:
This [lab](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa10/projects/search/search.html) is possible thanks to the generous contributions of the UC Berkeley AI division and their work on the Pac-Man Project.
