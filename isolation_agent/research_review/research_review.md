# Research Review
##AlphaGo by the DeepMind Team
[Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search] (https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/alphago/AlphaGoNaturePaper.pdf)

## Goals
* Develop a Go program to play at the level of the strongest human players
* Introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks

## Techniques
* Neural network to reduce depth and breadth of search tree with:
 * Value networks: To evaluate board positions
 * Policy networks: To sample actions
* Deep neural networks trained by 
 * Supervised learning by human expert games
 * Reinforcement learning from games of self-play

### Neural Network Archiecture 
* Neural network to predict human expert moves in a data set of positions:
 * Rollout policy 
 * Supervised learning (SL) policy network 
     * Alternates between convolutional layers with weights and rectifier nonlinearities 
     * Final softmax layer outputs a probability distribution over all legal moves  
 * Reinforcement learning (RL) policy network is initialized to the SL policy network 
     * Improved by policy gradient learning to maximize outcome
     * New data set is generated by self-play games with RL policy network
 * Reinforcement learning (RL) value network  
     * Focused on position evaluation 
     * Weights trained by regression to predict expected outcome  
 * Searching policy and value network with Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm
     * Selects actions by lookahead search 
* Policy network
 * Input: representation of board position 
 * Convolutional layers with parameters:
     * SL policy network
     * RL policy network 
 * Output: probability distribution over legal moves   
* Value network
  * Input: representation of board position 
  * Convolutional layers
  * Output: expected outcome


## Results
* New search algorithm:
 * Achieved 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs
 * Defeated the European Go champion by 5 games to 0
